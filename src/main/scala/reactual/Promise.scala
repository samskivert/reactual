/** Provides a concrete implementation of [[Future]] that can be updated with a success or failure
  * result when it becomes available.
  *
  * This implementation also guarantees a useful behavior, which is that all listeners added prior
  * to the completion of the promise will be cleared when the promise is completed, and no further
  * listeners will be retained. This allows the promise to be retained after is has been completed
  * as a useful "box" for its underlying value, without concern that references to long satisfied
  * listeners will be inadvertently retained.
